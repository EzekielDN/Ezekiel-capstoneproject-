# Purpose/Problem Statement
I made my program to abbe abble to save the data that is entered into and store it for a later use. This just helps you keep track of data you might need later.
# Target Audience 
This is for anyone to use in a quick manor so you don't forget any information as you're woeking.
# Solution + Limitations
I believe that my project helps those who need something very quickly. It doesn't redistrubute the data the way I like but it gets the jobs done.
# Key Features / Key Components 
The major parts of my program are: The Random API, while loop, continue, and break.
# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
My challenge with making this started with what API to use and how to implement it. I wish I spent time on how I wanted the program to look after it runs.
# Project Timeline
I started over a month ago by adding my orginal projecet to it so i could get down it down and brainstrom what I wantd to do from there. After that I added the random api and the resquats from it, as well as the URL. I didn't touch it much until just recently where I know have it completed with everything compeleted.
